## Summative assignment for intro to Linux and shell scripting
1. I first created a show script that prompts the user to enter their name which is then used to create a directory called **submission_reminder_{entered name}**


2. I then created another variable to represent the directory I had just created this variable is represented by the letter **"Y"**


3. Using the set variable above I followed by creating each individual sub-directory namely config, modules, app and assets 


4. I then proceeded to create the necessary files inside each of the sub-directories the files were **config.env, submissions.txt, reminder.sh functions.sh, startup.sh**


5. I then proceeded to populate the config.env file


6. Followed by populating the submissions.txt file with the necessary sample of students that was requested to be added by the summative assignment

7. The next step was populating the functions.sh file with the provided material and finally 


8. I proceeded to populate the reminder.sh file with the code provided by the summative instructions 

9. I then proceeded to populating the  startup.sh file with the code that contains the logic to run the entirety of this app


10. I also then proceeded to use the tree command such that when you launch the create_environment.sh file it will display the structure of the directory showing that it is similar to the one that was presented in the summative assignment I also then proceeded to Output a statement that reads displaying the tree structure of the directory this would help in giving a short description of why the trees being displayed


### HOW THE CODE WILL WORK

#### STEP 1: 
First and foremost you will first launch the **create_environment.sh** file which will then create the necessary directories and subdirectories as well as the files that will be necessary in operating the app altogether


#### STEP 2:
You will then proceed to change your directory to the **submission_reminder_{entered name}** 

#### STEP 3:
proceed to launch the startup.sh script this will prompt the application to run

#### THAT IS HOW YOU RUN THE APP
